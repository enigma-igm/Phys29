    "Finally, we can now better see why ```1e-308``` and ```1e308``` are the smallest and largest numbers that can be represented by a 64-bit floating point number. Namely, as an 11bit integer, the exponent $e$ can range from 0 to 2047, which means that $e-1023$ in the equation above can run from $-1023$ to $+1024$. Hence, the smallest possible value is $2^{-1023} =$ ```1.1e-308``` and the largest possible value of $2^{1024} =$ ```1.8e308```."
