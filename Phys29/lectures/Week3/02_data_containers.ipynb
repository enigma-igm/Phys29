    "    - The temperature on the Earth's surface as a function of two angular coordinates (latitude, longitude): $T(\\phi, \\theta)$\n",
    "    - A vector field, which is a vector function of cartesian coordinates in 3D space, for example the electric field in electricity and magnetism: $\\mathbf{E}(x,y,z)$ would have the three cartersian electric field components $E_x(x,y,z)$, $E_y(x,y,z)$, and $E_z(x,y,z)$, each of which is a scalar function of the three cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n",

    "Before we conclude our discussion of lists it is important to understand what is meant by the terms **mutable** versus **immutable**. A mutable object is one that can be changed after it is created, and an immutable object is one that cannot be changed after it is created. Lists are mutable, which means that you can change the values of the elements in the list after it is created as we did above. One thing that you need to be very careful with is that if you set a new list equal to an original list, and then change the values in the new list, the original list will also change. This is because the new variable is just a reference to the original list, not a copy of the list, and they point to the exact same location in the computers memory.  Here is an example:"
