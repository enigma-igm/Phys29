    "# Example of How to use AI Tools in this Course\n",
    "Over the past few years, AI code generation and explanation tools have become more widespread with the release of products like GitHub Copilot (free for students) and ChatGPT (currently free for the public). These AI tools are powered by so called Large Language Models (LLMs), which are enormous 'neural networks' trained on Petabytes of textual data or code scraped from the public internet. Their architecture enables them to 'learn' patterns from data and generate text and/or code that a human might plausibly write. Since code is a highly structured form of psuedo-English, these AI tools are very good at generating code for simple (and not so simple) tasks that are syntactically and (and also often) semantically correct."

They are stochastic, meaning that they can give different results for the same input. Furthermore, subtle differences in how you write your query can also result in not so subtle differences in the retrurned results, as this example shows.  This actually has to do with the generation of pseudo-random numbers in the AI model, which is a topic we will come to later in the course. "

    "McDonalds sells its Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 and 20 pieces. A customer would like to buy a number of N nuggets. Write a function that determines whether this is possible, and that returns all possible combinations of package sizes that would result in N nuggets. The input to the function should be the number of nuggets N. The function should return two outputs: a boolean (True or False) variable that is ```True``` if the number N can be purchased within the package constraints, and ```False``` otherwise, and all the possible combinations of package sizes that would result in N nuggets. The program should also print the results to the screen. If the number N cannot be purchased within the package size constraints, the program should print a message to the screen that says \"Sorry, that number of N nuggets cannot be purchased.\" Otherwise, the program should print a message to the screen that says \"You can purchase N nuggets with the following combinations of packages:\" followed by the list of possible combinations of packages.
