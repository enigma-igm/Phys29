Then  photograph your work and convert the photograph to a .pdf file using an online tool. Homework assignments can only be submitted as a single .pdf file, so you will also need to figure out how to concatenate your photo .pdf file and your notebook .pdf file into a single .pdf file that you can submit. Online websites can do this for you. Alternatively, you can code up the analytical solution to your problems in a notebook Markdown cell using the LaTeX mathematical rendering language. This is harder but a chatbot can help you learn it. </li>\n",
