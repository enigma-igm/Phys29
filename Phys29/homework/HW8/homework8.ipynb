    "## Problem 1: Propagating Uncertainty\n",

    "In lecture we discussed how to propagate uncertainties in a function of one or more variables. Consider the following equation \n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{G M_1 M_2}{r^2}\n",

    "which describes the gravitational force between two masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ separated by a distance $r$. For the purposes of this problem, assume that \n",
    "$G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}~{\\rm m}^3~{\\rm kg}^{-1}~{\\rm s}^{-2}$ is a constant that is known exactly with no uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that this problem has analytical parts and numerical parts, which are indicated below**. For the analytical parts your answer should not involve any computing (although you are free to do numerical experiments to hone your intuition).  Photograph your analytical solutions and concatenate with your Jupyter notebook into a single pdf file as described in the instructions above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**a**) Suppose that you have measured the values $M_1$, $M_2$, and $r$ from an experiment, which also yields their standard deviations $\\sigma_{M_1}$, $\\sigma_{M_2}$, and $\\sigma_r$. We will indicate this via the shorthand notation\n",

Make a histogram of the resulting random samples of $F$ and plot it using `matplotlib`. Make sure that you choose the number of bins in the histogram and the range of the $x$-axis appropriately. Use `scipy.stats` to overplot a curve showing the Gaussian distribution,  $\\mathcal{N}(F | \\langle F\\rangle,\\sigma_{F})$, where $\\langle F\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_{F}$ are the mean and standard deviation of $F$ that you computed via the analytical error propagation formulas in part **b)**.
