    "Using ${\\tt if}, {\\tt elif}, {\\tt else}$ statements, write a Python function that takes any three distinct real input numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, and returns the same values in a tuple in order of smallest to largest. For example, if $a=3$, $b=1$, and $c=2$, then the function should return the tuple $(1,2,3)$.  If $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=3$, then the function should return the tuple $(2,3,3)$.

An important value to quantity is floating-point accuracy which is referred to as the *machine epsilon*. Please read this [Wikipedia article on the machine epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon) to learn more about this important concept. \n",

    "## Problem 3: Numerical Derivatives\n",
    "In this problem we will explore the accuracy of numerical derivatives. Consider the function $f(x) = x^2(x-1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Analytically compute $f^\\prime(x)$ and evauate it at $x=1.0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Write a python function that estimates the derivative of $f(x)$ numerically using the forward difference formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^\\prime(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h$ is a small number.\n",
    "**c)** Write another python function that estimates the derivative of $f(x)$ numerically using the symmetric difference formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^\\prime(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "**d)** Calculate $f^\\prime(1.0)$ using your two numerical derivative functions for $h=10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, ....$ until something *really bad happens* (see below). Print out both $h$ and $f^\\prime(1.0)$, as $h$ becomes smaller and smaller. Format the output of $f^\\prime(1.0)$ to show 16 digits after the decimal point. Do the calculation using the built-in python float data type (nothing fancy please!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Based on your outputs from above, you should see that the symmetric difference formula is always more precise at a given value of $h$. To understand why this is the case we need a bit of calculcus. The Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x+h) = f(x) + h f^\\prime(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which states that for small values of $h$, the function can be expanded as a sum of powers of $h$ and higher order derivatives of $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytically derive expressions for $f^\\prime(x)$ using the Taylor expansion above for the two numerical derivative formulas that we employed in part (b) and (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Based on your answers to part (e), explain why the symmetric difference formula is always more precise than the forward difference formula in the limit $h\\rightarrow 0$. Note that the amount of computational work for both of the derivative estimators is the same, i.e. the function is evaluated at two locations, and then division by $h$ or $2h$ is performed. Hence, this problem illustrates that numerical derivatives should always be calculated  using symmetric differences whenever possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** As $h$ becomes *too small* the precision of both of the derivative estimators starts to degrade. This is because when $h$ is extremely small, taking the difference of $f(x+h)$ and $f(x - h)$ (or $f(x+h)$ and $f(x)$) becomes problematic as you are subtracting two numbers that are very close to each other. Read this Wikipedia article on [catastrophic cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation) and describe in your own words why the numerical preision degrades when $h$ becomes too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that catastrophic cancellation starts to degrade results when $h\\approx x\\sqrt{\\epsilon_m}$ (forward difference estimator) or \n",
    "$h\\approx x\\epsilon_m^{2/3}$ (symmetric difference estimator), where $\\epsilon_m\\simeq 2\\times 10^{-16}$ is the machine epsilon that we derived in Problem 3. These formulas are reliable provided that $x$ is not too close to zero (in our problem $x=1$ so we are okay).
