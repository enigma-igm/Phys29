Visualizing a Poisson process in the low count regime requires some thought since the statistics are not Gaussian and so error bars corresponding to e.g. the 16th and 84th percentile credibility interval are generally asymmetric, and only become symmetric in the limit of large counts (where the Poisson distribution tends toward a Gaussian distribution, see [Week 8 lecture notes](https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/blob/main/Phys29/lectures/Week8/01_random_numbers.ipynb)). Furthermore, if we detect zero photons in a pixel $k_\\lambda=0$ &mdash; a common occurrence if the rate $N_\\lambda$ is small &mdash; then it is unclear how to represent the error bar on such a measurement since \n",
