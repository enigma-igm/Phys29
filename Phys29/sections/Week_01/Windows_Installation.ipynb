    "\n",
    "Instead of using the Anaconda Navigator, you can also manage Anaconda/conda, python and jupyter notebooks in the command prompt in Windows.\n",

    "<img src=\"figures/cmd.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this terminal you can navigate your system folders, operate on files and execute commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, type \"conda --version\" and press enter. If you see an output like \"conda 23.7.4\", then congratulations, conda is successfully installed and you can now type \"jupyter lab\" or \"jupyter notebook\" into the command prompt and press enter to launch jupyter in your browser like in Step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more likely you will get this error message after entering \"conda --version\", or just \"conda\" in this screenshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/conda_command_not_found.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because even though Anaconda has just been installed, the Command Prompt doesn't know where to look for it. Windows (and any operating system) uses something called the \"environment variables\" to store some essential information, such as the paths to find installed softwares. So, you need to add the installation path of Anaconda to the \"PATH\" environment variable in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will show two ways to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first method (and the easy way) did not work for me due to a character limit imposed on the \"PATH\" variable by Windows. I will still show it in case it works for you. Simply type the following two lines into the command prompt (one line at a time, press enter after each line), replacing \"C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Anaconda3\" with the actual path on your Windows device. For example, my user name is mingh, and I installed anaconda in the default location, I would replace it with \"C:\\Users\\mingh\\Anaconda3\" etc...\n",

    "<img src=\"figures/set_path1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/set_path2.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now close the command prompt and open a new one, type \"conda\" or \"conda --version\" again. If you get the same error message, then try the second method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second method, use the \"Win\" button on your keyboard to call up the search box, type \"environment variables\", and you should find \"Edit the system environment variables\":\n",

    "\n",
    "click on \"Environment Variables\", and you should see this new window:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/set_path_alternative_3.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "now, first select \"Path\", then click \"Edit...\":\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/set_path_alternative_4.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "now click \"New\", and add the two paths shown in the screenshot above. Remember to replace the username \"mingh\" in the screenshot with your own username as well as your actual installation path for Anaconda if you didn't choose the default location!\n",
    "\n",
